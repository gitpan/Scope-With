Scope::With 0.01

Scope::With provides an implementation of the JavaScript with statement. Subroutines
inside the with block that correspond to methods on the value passed into
the with statement (the invocant) invoke the corresponding method on that value
with the supplied arguments. The subroutines are lexically-scoped, and are not
defined outside of the block.
